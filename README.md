# ðŸ¦º Advanced Construction Site Safety: PPE Detection with Edge and Fog Computing

## Project Overview

This project enhances safety at construction sites by detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance using real-time object detection. 
It employs the YOLOv8 deep learning model to identify safety gear such as helmets, vests, and masks. The system is optimized for 
edge and fog computing environments, enabling immediate alerts and responses to non-compliance.

## Objectives

- Detect PPE (helmet, vest, mask) in real-time.
- Use edge devices for on-site, low-latency detection.
- Apply fog computing to handle alerts and analytics.
- Promote worker safety through automated compliance monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Python, OpenCV, PyTorch
- Edge Devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)
- Fog Node (Flask server or lightweight cloud)
- Construction Site Safety Image Dataset
- Jupyter Notebooks for model training
